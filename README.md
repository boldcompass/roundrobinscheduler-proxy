Round Robin Scheduler Proxy
=========================
This proxy is designed to be used in conjunction with the [Some Techie Round Robin Scheduler](https://github.com/sometechie/roundrobinscheduler). It allows devices not on the WiFi network to participate in scorekeeping.

Note: Scorekeepers on the WiFi network and scorekeepers using 3G/4G can use the scorekeeping web page at the same time.

#Setup
1. [Download the files](https://github.com/sometechie/roundrobinscheduler-proxy/archive/master.zip)
2. Copy the files to a publicly accessible web folder
3. Change the shared key to something more secure
4. Enter the shared key and url to the proxy folder into the Round Robin Scheduler on the 3G/4G tab of the Scorekeepers page
5. Start the web server from the menu and the proxy from the 3G/4G tab
